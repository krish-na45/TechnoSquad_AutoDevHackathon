# Auto Dev–Synapse Platform

A multi-agent orchestration platform that converts a natural-language DevOps requirement into a working full-stack application, with:

Backend API

Frontend UI

Database schema

Deployment artifacts

Validation & test signals


No single “magic AI”.
This is agent-based execution, which is the correct modern approach.
