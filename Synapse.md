# 3. Synapse Orchestrator (CORE INNOVATION)

What Makes This Unique

This is NOT a chatbot.

The Synapse Orchestrator:

Controls agent execution order

Passes outputs between agents

Stops hallucinations by enforcing structure

Tracks execution state


Execution Flow

1. Planner Agent creates a task roadmap


2. Meta-Refiner cleans user ambiguity


3. DB Architect defines schema


4. Backend Coder generates API


5. Frontend Coder binds UI


6. Legacy Agent checks compatibility


7. Sentinel validates outputs


8. Deployment Agent packages system



This is deterministic orchestration, not prompt chaos.
